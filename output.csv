"Google wants to help you hide your IP
address when you're surfing the internet,",0.12,3.06
"how they're baking in proxies into their
Chrome browser. That's kind of weird,",3.75,3.45
"a little crazy. Actually. Chrome is
calling it their IP protection feature,",7.26,3.33
"and it involves running their own proxy,",10.68,1.71
"which they're calling the
privacy proxy private.",12.395,2.605
"As long as Google doesn't
look at your stuff,",15.0,1.74
"we'll talk about that
here in a bit. In fact,",16.95,1.59
"it's actually pretty easy to run your
own proxy. I'll show you how to do that.",18.81,3.12
"Check the timestamps. It'll take
about two minutes. But first,",22.08,2.94
"let's talk about proxies. They're great
and they've been around for a long time,",25.02,3.48
"helping people hide their IP address
and maintain a bit of privacy.",28.62,2.94
"But what is it? How does it
work? When you visit a website,",31.95,2.76
"that website can see your IP address,
which can tell them a lot about you.",34.83,3.66
According to Google's own document.,38.76,1.41
"Your IP address makes it feasible to
associate what you're doing with where",40.17,3.57
"you've been. And why that's
dangerous is over time,",43.74,2.49
"all the information can be combined to
create a unique persistent profile about",46.56,4.56
"you, and they can use that to
track your activity across the web.",51.12,3.12
"And unlike cookies, which we can
opt out of IP address tracking,",54.39,3.03
"it's more covert. You can't just
opt out. It just kind of happens.",57.42,3.54
So this is why people use proxies.,60.99,1.74
"A proxy is just a server that sits in
the middle of the communication between",62.76,3.42
you and the website.,66.185,1.615
"The proxy server will handle
the communication between
you and that website,",68.04,3.63
"and instead of the website
seeing your IP address,",71.7,2.13
"it'll see the proxy server's
IP address, hiding yours,",73.86,3.0
"preventing it from tracking you,
learning you, knowing you, using you,",77.07,3.39
and all that other creepy stuff.,80.67,1.11
"It's kind of like when you're
in a fight with your friend Bob,",82.23,1.86
"and you'll want to tell him something,
but you can't. You're mad at him, right?",84.24,2.64
"So you tell your friend
Stacey to tell him,",87.06,1.59
"and then he tells your friend Stacey
to tell you, yada, yada, yada.",88.95,3.18
"Stacey's a proxy. That's
what I was trying to say.",92.31,2.46
"You can also use a proxy to travel
the world. You want to be in France,",95.01,3.09
"put your proxy in France, and
suddenly you're French or Stacey is.",98.28,4.5
"And because websites only see Stacey,",102.9,1.53
"they think you're French and
you can access everything.",104.76,2.31
"The French internet has to
offer all that geoblock content.",107.07,3.27
"But don't get too excited. Google isn't
going to allow this with their proxy,",110.58,3.15
"but you can certainly do it with your
own. Again, I'll show you how. Now,",114.0,2.94
"if you've seen enough VPN sponsored ads
on YouTube, you're probably thinking,",116.94,3.03
"isn't this just AVPN? Are we
talking about the same thing? No.",120.27,3.96
"While sharing similar goals,",124.53,1.35
"the main difference between AVPN and a
proxy is AVPN will actually encrypt your",125.91,4.14
"data over a secure tunnel. While
a proxy won't encrypt anything,",130.05,3.42
"they'll just forward it over not
changing anything about your data.",133.47,2.97
"And because the proxy isn't
worried about encrypting your data,",136.56,2.46
"it's typically much faster. Encryption
takes time. It's a bit heavier.",139.35,3.09
"So when you think proxies think fast,",142.44,1.89
"and when you're thinking
about hosting your own server,",144.39,2.1
"hosting a proxy server is much less
resource intensive versus hosting a VP n",146.67,4.02
"server, which again
has to encrypt traffic.",150.69,2.13
"But when we're talking about hiding your
IP address, they both help you. Now,",152.85,3.09
let's talk about Google running a proxy.,155.94,2.04
"Have you ever heard of a
man in the middle attack?",158.49,1.77
"It's a hacking technique where a hacker
will sit himself in the middle between",160.44,4.05
"you and the website
you're trying to visit,",164.49,1.74
"and he tries to steal your information.
He sees everything going back and forth.",166.59,4.05
He can observe it and possibly take it.,170.76,2.1
"It sounds kind of like what
Google's about to do, right?",172.905,2.325
"They're putting themselves in the
middle of our traffic and they have the",175.26,2.91
potential to.,178.17,0.7
"See everything. Now, I'm not
saying Google is going to do that.",178.87,2.7
"I'm just saying the potential is created
by doing that. And let's be honest,",181.63,3.81
"does Google really need to do that?
They already see all of our traffic,",185.47,3.33
"but to put us at ease,
according to the document,",188.8,1.98
"one of the core requirements of their
privacy prox is that the proxy will not be",190.81,3.12
"privy to the contents of the
traffic. So they're like,",193.93,3.06
"we're not going to look at it. Trust
us. You know what I mean? And again,",197.02,3.18
"this does open up a ton of concerns,
some that even Google recognizes.",200.2,3.21
"They're like, Hey, yeah, about
that right here. The first concern,",203.41,3.51
"and this is a pretty big one,",206.92,1.05
"is what if the proxy server owned by
Google that has all of our stuff going",208.24,4.11
"through it? What if it gets hacked?
Think about it. If you're a hacker,",212.35,2.67
"suddenly you don't need to try and hack
thousands, millions of individuals.",215.17,4.11
"All you got to do is hack one
of Google's proxy servers,",219.37,2.1
"and you get all that information
potentially. Another one
is denial of service.",221.5,4.41
"What if the hacker doesn't
want to steal the information?",225.94,1.92
They just want to watch the world burn.,227.86,1.35
"So they will try to take down these
Google proxies through a DDoS attacker",229.33,4.53
distributed denial of service attack.,233.86,1.59
"And if everyone's using these proxies
to go to the internet and access",235.54,3.87
"everything, that impacts stability
of the entire internet. Now, sure,",239.41,3.99
"someone like me, and maybe you could
figure it out and be like, yeah,",243.4,3.3
"that's because of that Google proxy.
Let's just not use it for now.",246.76,2.73
"Other people won't realize
that and they'll think, oh,",249.58,2.13
"I guess the internet died.
You know what I mean?",251.71,2.4
"It's that single point of failure
mentality. You don't want that.",254.14,3.18
"And then also going through Google Proxies
could disrupt a lot of the defenses",257.41,3.96
that we already have for online attacks.,261.46,2.25
"Google will effectively be changing the
way the internet works by having a lot",263.74,4.23
"of people go through its proxies.
I won't go deep into that,",267.97,2.46
"but just know it will change things.
So to mitigate those concerns,",270.43,3.36
"they will require
authentication to their proxy,",273.85,2.13
"which will require a Google account
in which off tokens will be issued and",276.13,3.75
redeemed at the proxy.,279.88,1.26
"They'll also be using blinded signatures
so they can't identify your traffic and",281.23,3.75
"tie it to who you are.
And to limit DDoS attacks,",284.98,2.61
"they'll be rate limiting tokens per
account and having token expiry.",287.59,4.17
"I like saying the word
expiry makes me feel British.",291.82,2.22
"And then one more thing here. This is
actually kind of cool. So good job Google,",294.25,3.33
"and they are promising they're going
to do it. It's in their roadmap,",297.58,2.85
"but they're considering,",300.46,1.17
"I hope it's more than a consideration
using two hops for improved privacy.",302.08,3.96
"So right now,",306.22,0.39
"the proposed plan would be a Google
owned proxy that we would all go through.",306.61,3.87
"Again, our concerns, see
the concerns from earlier.",310.66,2.25
"They're talking about adding
an extra hop, another proxy.",313.33,3.3
"So I'll have two total proxies
between us and our website.",316.66,2.34
"And the second proxy will be run
by someone else that's not Google,",319.09,2.91
"ACDN or a content delivery network.
Maybe CloudFlare or Akamai.",322.06,4.14
"Google will still run the first hop,",326.32,1.86
"but the second will be
someone else ensuring that
neither proxy can see both the",328.39,4.14
client IP address and the destination.,332.53,2.07
"Which is funny because this kind
of sounds like the Onion Network,",334.63,3.24
"the Tor network, the dark web,",337.87,1.29
"and how they obscure our identities and
keep people anonymous through multiple",339.16,3.45
"hops, onion relays.",342.76,1.2
"So I think this actually could be
pretty cool as long as they take their",344.08,2.37
"consideration into action. We'll
see. And then as I mentioned earlier,",346.45,3.54
"GOIP,",350.32,1.14
"one of the benefits of a proxy is that
we can appear to be from anywhere in the",351.64,2.94
"world on the internet, which is
pretty cool. Now it's Google's proxy.",354.58,3.16
"They're going to have to comply with
local laws and regulation that have to do",357.86,3.45
with content localization.,361.31,1.32
"So the privacy proxy will assign IP
addresses that represent the user's",362.66,4.65
"course location or I guess approximate
location, including their country.",367.37,3.57
"And they do have a document on
their IP approach for IP protection.",371.15,3.15
"Here's what the map will
look like, so I do get it.",374.42,2.19
"They do need to comply with laws, all
the more reason to use your own proxy.",376.61,3.09
"So when can we expect to see
this? How's it going to work?",379.73,2.43
"When will the world drastically
change? With proxies,",382.22,2.37
"it's going to be a slow
rollout, a phase approach.",384.62,2.04
"Initially it'll be opt-in only,",386.72,1.71
"so you'll have to actually turn the
setting on yourself. And in phase zero,",388.64,3.3
"it'll be one single Google own proxy,",391.94,2.04
"and it will only proxy requests
to Google owned domains.",394.22,3.24
"The test will only be
US-based IP addresses,",397.52,2.31
"and only a small percentage of clients
will be automatically enrolled into the",399.89,3.3
"initial test. And again,",403.19,1.2
"part of their security features is that
a user must be logged in to Chrome in",404.39,4.11
"order to generate that user token
to authenticate with a proxy.",408.5,3.06
"So currently in Google Chrome,
we are in, we're in one 18,",411.77,4.11
"and we can expect to see this start
happening between M one 19 and M 1 25,",416.24,4.92
"and there's the flag name for that
particular setting. When it comes out.",421.55,3.57
"Be looking for that. Honestly,",425.12,1.56
"I'm kind of excited about this because
Google is helping out with privacy.",426.68,3.48
"For most people,",430.16,1.26
"it's a good step because most people
are not going to run their own proxy,",431.48,3.69
"but you're not like most people, you are
going to run your own proxy right now.",435.5,3.78
"It's so crazy, so fast, let's do
it. And come on. I mean, honestly,",439.34,3.66
"wouldn't you rather own your own
proxy versus Google doing it for you?",443.0,4.02
"I want to own my own privacy,",447.08,1.2
"and I'm actually going to show
you two ways to run a proxy.",448.4,2.22
"The first one is ridiculously easy. It's
always been there right next to you.",450.62,3.99
"And the second one is more robust. It
actually kind of operates like AVPN.",454.67,3.6
"It's a proxy, but it will also encrypt
your traffic. It's called Shadow Socks,",458.27,3.99
"which kind of sounds like a superhero
cat. I'm down for that. For both options,",462.32,3.66
"all you'll need is a Linux-based
server. It doesn't even have to be big.",465.98,2.88
"It can be super tiny.
And for my Linux server,",468.86,1.95
"because I want to be
anywhere in the world,",470.81,1.92
"I'm going to spend mine up in the
cloud with Anode by Akamai. Now,",472.76,2.7
"as you can see, I do run a ton
of anode servers in the cloud.",475.46,2.79
"I use 'em for all my projects.
Anyways, let's create one real quick.",478.25,2.7
"I'm going to run the latest version
of Ubuntu that they offer and region.",481.16,3.3
"This is where it gets fun. Where am I
going to be today? I want to be in Osaka.",484.46,3.63
"I'm actually going to Japan in about
three weeks. Two weeks for a month.",488.15,3.42
So I'm practicing. So I'll be in Osaka.,491.57,1.44
"I'll do the shared TPU and the smallest
plan. They have just five bucks a month.",493.07,3.42
"I'll name it Japan Proxy, put a
password in and click on Create.",496.55,3.48
"And within moments, I'll have my very
own proxy server. The cloud in Japan,",500.035,4.075
"my Linux server is done brewing. I'm going
to go ahead and access it real quick.",504.17,3.0
"Going to grab my SSH command, copy that.
Launch my terminal here in Windows.",507.175,4.165
"It'll be the same in Mac and
Linux. Paste that in, hit enter,",511.37,2.91
"accept all fingerprints. And we're in.
Now, this is going to blow your mind.",514.34,3.18
"One of the best ways to run a
proxy is just through having SSH.",517.58,3.3
"So what I just used to access the server,
SSH or Secure Shell is the same thing.",520.94,4.05
"We'll use to set up a proxy.
And when I say set up,",524.99,2.19
"I mean like it's done as long
as you have open SSH installed,",527.18,4.23
"which if you access your server that
way, it already is just to make sure,",531.53,3.09
"we'll try it out. APT
install, open SSH dash server.",534.625,4.595
"See, mine's already installed. All
you got to do is enter that command,",539.46,2.37
"see if it is. If it isn't,
install it. We're good to go.",541.86,2.16
"Now that's all I have to do. I'm just
going to set up my clients, my computers.",544.08,3.84
"So phone and computers, I dunno why
I said that. I'll start with Windows.",548.07,4.17
"And here in Windows, I do recommend
using Firefox with a proxy,",552.27,3.18
"mainly because I could not get
it to work with anything else.",555.45,2.28
"So launching Firefox, let's just do
a little test real quick. Let's do a,",557.76,3.48
"what's my IP address? Now,",561.24,3.15
"I'm not going to let you see it because
my editor's going to blur it out,",564.45,2.37
"right Nick, but looking at
what is my IP address.com,",566.82,2.85
"you can clearly see that I am in
Dallas, Texas. What do you say?",569.67,2.91
We changed that.,572.58,0.63
"Now our first step in setting up this
proxy is establishing an SSH tunnel.",573.21,3.21
"So all we're going to do, it
sounds scary, but it's not.",576.42,1.62
"We're going to launch our
terminal here in Windows.",578.04,1.65
"So we'll use the SSH command.
I told you it's all SSH,",579.69,2.4
"and we'll do the option dash or
tick D, and we'll type in a port.",582.15,3.24
"We'll just do 1, 3, 3 7. What
this is doing is powerful.",585.395,3.445
"It's opening up a SOX proxy, a
proxy protocol. That is awesome.",588.87,3.96
"It'll do T-C-P-U-D-P, whatever you
want. We'll then do a dash capital N,",592.83,4.14
"which is telling it to not execute remote
commands. We're just forwarding ports.",597.03,3.18
"And then we'll do a dash capital C to
compress the data over our tunnel to save",600.21,3.81
"bandwidth. And then finally, our proxy
server. Now getting back to Lynn node,",604.02,3.12
"I'm going to grab my IP address of my
proxy server, and I'll say my username,",607.17,3.3
"which is root at my proxy server. Now,
let's go ahead and do this. Ready, set,",610.47,3.93
"go, hit enter, accept all
fingerprints. Put your password in,",614.4,2.79
"and you're probably waiting like,
okay, now what? Yeah, it's done.",617.4,3.36
"The tunnel's created. It's open.
And with the tunnel created,",620.88,2.4
"now we're going to just tell our
computer to use itself as a proxy. What?",623.28,3.9
"Let me show you. So here in Firefox,
I'm going to go to settings.",627.33,3.51
"Let's go in my little dialogue here
and go to settings and I'll search for",630.87,2.91
"proxy. There it is. Just click on
proxy settings and network settings.",633.78,3.06
"And here I'm going to click
on manual proxy configuration.",636.93,2.79
"And all I'm going to worry
about is the SOX host.",639.75,2.4
"That's what we're running right now.
There I'm going to type in local hosts,",642.21,2.67
"which means we're going to look
at ourselves for the proxy,",644.91,2.25
"and we're going to tell the port
that we just used 1, 3, 3 7.",647.19,3.27
"So we created the tunnel
to our proxy server,",650.49,1.74
"and now we're telling our browser to use
ourselves and go over that tunnel for",652.23,4.2
"internet. It'll make sense. Watch
this. I'll click okay. And that's it.",656.43,4.05
"That's all we had to do. So now
over here on what's my IP address?",660.48,3.96
"If I refresh this, we are
in Japan. Do you see that?",664.47,4.38
"If I go to Google, I bet it'll put things
in Japanese for me. Yep. Look at that.",668.94,4.95
"I am loving this. See, I just
traveled across the world.",673.95,2.43
"And when you're done with
the proxy, of course,",676.44,1.56
"change your proxy settings in
Firefox. Just say no proxy for now.",678.0,3.51
"And then if you go back to your terminal,",681.57,1.08
"just hit C and your terminal's
closed or not your terminal,",682.65,3.63
"your tunnel is closed. The
process is very similar on Ubuntu,",686.31,3.18
"setting up my SSH tunnel and
changing my proxy setting.",689.58,2.91
"So I can do this globally inside of
Ubuntu to where everything goes across it,",692.49,3.42
"specifying local hosts and
port 1, 3, 3, 7, that simple.",695.97,3.72
"And launching Firefox. It's very
clear that I am in Japan. Yeah,",699.75,3.75
"very clearly in Japan. I love it. So
those are the steps across the board.",703.53,3.57
"Set up your SSH tunnel and then configure
your proxy settings to look at your",707.13,3.21
"local host. Now, that wasn't
hard, right? It's kind of awesome.",710.34,2.76
"Now it's time for the second way, and
it's actually also not very hard at all.",713.14,3.48
"This will involve setting up a Shadow
SOX server, which will be our SOX proxy.",716.65,3.57
"And then we'll also install a
Shadow SOX client on our devices.",720.25,3.03
"And you can install that pretty
much anywhere. Windows, Mac, Linux,",723.46,2.61
"and even your phone. And the
server setup is stupid easy,",726.07,3.36
"especially on anode because Anode has
a marketplace and I can just go to the",729.46,4.11
marketplace and search for shadow socks.,733.57,2.13
They've got a little item here to set up.,735.73,1.92
"All I have to do is put in my
passwords, create a limited pseudo user,",737.68,3.03
"a password for that user, and then
region. Oh, another important thing to do.",741.01,3.75
"Oh, I want to go to Mumbai. Yes,
again, shared CPU lowest one,",744.85,3.48
"five bucks a month. I'll call it Shadow
socks. Mumbai, create a root password,",748.33,4.17
"all the passwords here, and
then click on create Leno.",752.8,2.97

coffee break while it's Brewing Network.",755.86,3.09

while that's brewing,",758.95,1.74

"actually while it's provisioning. While
it's brewing, we can install our client.",768.7,3.18
"I will have links for this below. I'll
just go to shadow socks on the interwebs,",771.91,4.02
"go to their GitHub and I
should be able to find, yeah,",776.14,2.16

to their latest release. Again,",778.3,2.82

download that zip extract it here,",781.12,3.3

it. I think it is done.",790.06,1.32
